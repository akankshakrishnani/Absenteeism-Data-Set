# Absenteeism-Data-Set
Working on  a data to predict and analyse the high number of absenteeism at work

Data Preprocessing:

First, we will preprocess the data. We devote a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task.

We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.


 

Machine Learning:

This section will incorporate the work we did in the preprocessing part into the code necessary for making the next step. Namely, to develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work.

For our case study, this will be a logistic regression model. Numerous machine learning tools and techniques will help us at this stage. At the end, we will store our work as a Python module that we will call ‘absenteeism_module’ and will thus preserve it in a form suitable for further analysis.

 

Loading the ‘absenteeism_module’:

We will  also load the ‘absenteeism_module’ and use its methods to obtain predictions.

 

Analyzing the predicted outputs in Tableau:

Finally, we will use Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of our model. The visualizations we will obtain with this software will help us a great deal while looking for insights.
